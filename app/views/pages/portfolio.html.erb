          <div class="recommendation">
            <p>Léa worked as an intern at the Finnish Broadcasting Company (Yle) for three months in the summer of 2016.
            Léa worked on two projects during the internship. (...) In both projects Léa's productivity was very high
             and she was able to deliver high quality code and increase the overall productivity of the team.
            </p>
            <p>Léa was exceptionally fast to learn new technologies, workflows, architectures and concepts.
              She often took the initiative to solve issues independently. She has a strong work ethic and great focus
              on what she is doing. As a consequence, she is certainly one of the best interns we have worked with.
            </p>

              Co-signed by the Head of Interfaces and a fellow Web Developer
